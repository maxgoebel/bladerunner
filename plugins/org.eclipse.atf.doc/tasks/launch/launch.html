<h1>Launching an AJAX Application</h1>

<p>Launching an AJAX application takes advantage of the enhanced ATF DHTML tooling and launches the application in the 
embedded Mozilla browser. To do this, select the application's control file (i.e. html file), right click and select
<strong>Run As &gt; Run in Mozilla.</strong> If a server has not been defined for the target application, one will have to be
created at this point using the dialogs provided. Once a server has been defined and saved, the application control file will be
launched using the embedded Mozilla browser within Eclipse. With the Mozilla browser, the user has the ability to use the additional
DHTML tools that ATF provides, such as the DOM Inspector and JavaScript console, to assist in debugging the Dojo web application.</p>
