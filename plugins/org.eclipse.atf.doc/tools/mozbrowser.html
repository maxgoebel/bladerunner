<h1>Embedded Mozilla Browser</h1>

<p>The Embedded Mozilla Browser is the central piece of an effort to integrate
the Mozilla Browser into Eclipse and use it as part of the Web development process.
It shows up in Eclipse's editor area and contains a cross-platform Mozilla Browser
widget. This component provides the basic functionality of a standalone Mozilla 
installation as well as integration with other supporting Eclipse views.
</p>

<p>The Embedded Mozilla Browser editor communicates with a set of Browser Tools views,
 such as the <a href="dominspect.html">DOM Inspector</a> view and the 
<a href="browserconsole.html">Browser Console</a> view). These views and the Browser editor are
aggregated by the Mozilla Perspective. To open the Mozilla Perspective, go to the
<i>Windows</i> menu, select <i>Open Perspective</i>, <i>Other</i>. From the 
<i>Select Perspective</i> dialog, select <i>Mozilla</i>.
</p>

<p>There are several ways of opening the Embedded Mozilla Browser.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click on the toolbar button <img src="imgs/mozilla.png"> when in the Mozilla Perspective.</li>
	<li>Run or Debug a Web Application using the <i>Run As/Run in Mozilla</i>
	 or <i>Debug As/Debug in Mozilla</i> context menu, respectively. (More information
	 under the individual AJAX Personalities section)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Browser has several features aside from the usual navigation components. Some of these
features are:</p>

<b>Ctrl-Click Selection</b><br>
<img src="../screencaps/browserSelection.jpg">
<p>This allows the developer to select a DOM Node by using the mouse and selecting 
an area of the rendered page on the browser. To do this:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Enable <i>Ctrl-Click Selection</i> by pressing <img src="imgs/revealBySelection.gif"> located on the upper-right corner of the Browser.</li>
 <li>Move the Mouse cursor over the page while holding down the Ctlr key (Cmd key for
 Macs) and you will see a highlight border around  the rendered DOM Node.</li>
 <li>Click on the mouse to broadcast the DOM Node as the selection to
 all the Browser Tools views (i.e. <a href="dominspect.html">DOM Inspector</a>).</li>
</ol>
<br>

<b>Clear the Browser's Cache</b>
<ol>
 <li>Click on the Browser's menu <img src="imgs/showMenu.gif"> located on the upper-right corner of the Browser.</li>
 <li>Select the Clear Cache menu item.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<b>Selection Path Bar</b><br>
<img src="imgs/selectionBar.jpg">
<p>This bar is located on the bottom edge of the Browser. It can be opened or closed by using the
Browser's menu <img src="imgs/showMenu.gif"> located on the upper-right corner of the Browser.
This bar shows the currently selected DOM Node in the form of a Path from the DOM Document root
to itself. Each portion of the path is a link that causes the selection to change. This bar
is also helpful to see what is going to be selected while doing a <i>Ctrl-Click Selection</i> by
showing the developer what is the path to the DOM Node that is under the mouse cursor.
