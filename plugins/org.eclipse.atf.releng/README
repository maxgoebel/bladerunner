	- Restart Eclipse with the "-clean" flag (i.e. eclipse -clean) from a command line

-------------------------------
Finalizing an ATF Installation:
-------------------------------
Upon installing ATF through the downloadable zip file, certain pieces of 3rd party content
should be added to some of the plugins in order to gain ATF's full functionality. The 
purpose of this section is to specify where to get these pieces of 3rd party content, and
where to place the content within the installed plugins.

- In the org.eclipse.atf.personality.rico.runtime plugin:
  - under the resources/ directory
    - add prototype.js
    - add rico.js
    
  Note: prototype.js and rico.js can be downloaded from
  http://www.openrico.org/rico/downloads.page
  
  Note: this has only been tested with prototype 1.3.1 and rico 1.1-beta2
  
- In the org.eclipse.atf.personality.dojo.runtime plugin:
  - under the resources/ directory
    - add demos
    - add src
    - add build.txt
    - add CHANGELOG
    - add dojo.js
    - add dojo.js.uncompressed.js
    - add iframe_history.html
    - add LICENSE
    - add README
    
  Note: Dojo can be downloaded from 
  http://dojotoolkit.org/download/
  
  Note: this has only been tested with Dojo 0.2.2
  
- In the org.eclipse.atf.javascript.validator plugin:
  - add jslint.js directly under the top level plugin

  Note: you can obtain jslint.js by:
    - Go to the URL, http://www.jslint.com/fulljslint.js
    - Save the page as "jslint.js"

-------------------------------------------
Reconstituting the ATF Eclipse Source Tree:
-------------------------------------------
The ATF CVS source code contains a 'trimmed' version of the AJAX Toolkit Framework, 
meaning that there is no 3rd party code included. The purpose of this section is to 
a) tell you what was removed and b) advise you on how you may pull in the 
missing pieces to make a buildable ATF source tree of your own.

Here's what has been trimmed and what needs to be done:

- In the org.eclipse.atf.personality.rico.runtime plugin:
  - in the resources/ directory
    - add prototype.js
    - add rico.js

  Note: you can obtain prototype.js and rico.js from 
  http://openrico.org/rico/downloads.page
  
  Note: this has only been tested with prototype 1.3.1 and rico 1.1-beta2

- In the org.eclipse.atf.personality.dojo.runtime plugin:
  - in the resources/ directory
    - add demos
    - add src
    - add build.txt
    - add CHANGELOG
    - add dojo.js
    - add dojo.js.uncompressed.js
    - add iframe_history.html
    - add LICENSE
    - add README

  Note: you can obtain the necessary Dojo code from 
  http://dojotoolkit.org/download/
  
  Note: this has only been tested with Dojo 0.2.2
  
  Note: The ATF javascript validator will flag a few of the base Dojo
  javascript source files as having errors. These "errors" can be ignored
  and should not cause any break in Dojo functionality. 

- In the org.eclipse.atf.javascript.validator plugin:
  - add jslint.js under top level of the plugin

  Note: you can obtain jslint.js by:
    - Go to the URL, http://www.jslint.com/fulljslint.js
    - Save the page as "jslint.js"

- Add the 

  org.mozilla.javascript 
  org.mozilla.xpcom
  org.eclipse.atf.personality.zimbra.runtime
  
  plugins:

    - download
      - ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/eclipse/plugins/org.mozilla.javascript_1.6.2.jar
      - ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.0.1/eclipse/org.mozilla.xpcom_1.8.0.1.jar
	  - http://cvs.zimbra.com/org.eclipse.atf.personality.zimbra.runtime_3.1.0.jar
    
    - then in the Explorer view:
      - Import... -> Plug-in Development -> External Plug-ins and Fragments
	  - Uncheck "The target platform..." box
	  - Specify the location of the folder containing three plugins in the Plug-in Location
	  - Click Next >
	  - Select the three plugins and click Add
	  - Click Finish

- If you are running on Linux:
  -in the org.eclipse.atf.mozilla.swt.browser plugin, copy .classpath_gtk over .classpath, ie:
  
    cp .classpath_gtk .classpath

  (or something of that nature). The default .classpath is set up for Windows.

- Rebuild (clean) your workspace
  - Project -> Clean... -> Clean All Projects

- If you still see compilation errors try restarting Eclipse: during testing, the most common issue we 
  hit was some problem with the prerequisites not being completely or correctly 
  installed. Please check to make sure that all elements of Eclipse and WTP have
  been installed correctly and at the correct level.

----------
Using ATF:
----------
  
- See Help -> Help Contents -> AJAX Toolkit Framework

-------------
Known Issues:
-------------
- We've had reports of intermittent problems bringing up Mozilla for the
  first time when installing under Linux. If this happens, try running it
  again -- the problem appears to resolve itself on the second try. We are
  investigating the problem.
  
- Occasional synchronization problems occur when running your application
  on Mozilla and you'll get a 404 error when the browser comes up. If this
  happens, a shift-Reload will fix the problem.
